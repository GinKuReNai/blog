import SkillSet from "@components/SkillSet.astro";

I'm Akito Koga. I work as a software enginner in Tokyo, Japan.
After graduating from Kyushu Institute of Technology with a degree of Computer Science, I have been working in develpment as a backend engineer.

I have loved programming since I was a little kid and have always called myself a computer geek.
Through this blog, I hope to be of service to the development community by sharing my technical knowledge and interests.
